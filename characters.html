            <h3 class="heading-flex">Actor Tatiana Maslany as: Sarah</h3>
            <p> Tatiana Maslany as a number of clones (Sarah Manning, Beth Childs, Katja Obinger, Alison Hendrix, Cosima Niehaus, Helena, Rachel Duncan, Jennifer Fitzsimmons, Tony Sawicki, Krystal Goderitch, Veera "MK" Suominen), all born in 1984 to
              various women by in vitro fertilisation. Their creation was referred to as Project Leda. The series focuses on Sarah Manning, a small-time con woman and orphan who is the only clone to have a biological daughter. (All clones were
              presumed to be sterile before Sarah was discovered, with one of the original scientists revealing that the clones, as 'prototypes', were all designed to be sterile, and it is also revealed in season 2 that Helena is also able to
              conceive given
              her origin as Sarah's specific twin.) Other clones include Elizabeth "Beth" Childs, a police detective whose suicide at the start of the series leads Sarah into the conspiracy; Alison Hendrix, a soccer mom who tries to be the perfect
              housewife, but suffers from pill and drink addiction as well as jumping to conclusions; Cosima Niehaus, a lesbian graduate student studying evolutionary developmental ("evo-devo") biology who researches the clones' biology; Helena,
              the twin sister of Sarah, a fanatic assassin trained by the Proletheans who has suffered severe abuse throughout her life; Rachel Duncan, an executive at the Dyad Institute, who was raised knowing that she is a clone from childhood.
              Maslany also voiced the scorpion, called Pupok, that speaks to Helena in her hallucinations in Season 3.

            <h3 class="heading"> Actor Jordan Gavaris as: Felix <q>Fee</q> Dawkins</h3>
            <p> Felix, Sarah's gay foster brother and confidant; when none of her sisters are available, he acts as Sarah's backup. During childhood, they were quite close, but she often abused him for amusement; they are still close as adults. He
              identifies as a modern artist, but moonlights as a prostitute. He is the first person Sarah confides in about the existence of clones, and has developed his own friendship with Alison in particular while helping her cope with the stress
              of her existence as a clone.During Seasons 2 and 3, Cosima stays with him, due to her declining health.

            <h3 class="heading-flex">Actor Maria Doyle Kennedy as: Siobhan Sadler</h3>
            <p> Maria Doyle Kennedy as Siobhan Sadler, Sarah's and Felix's Irish foster mother; they call her "Mrs. S.". She fell in love with and married John Sadler at a young age, befriending his group of freedom fighters – the Birdwatchers. After
              John was murdered in a fight with her mother back in '78, Siobhan started a new relationship with Carlton. She acts as guardian to Sarah's daughter Kira while Sarah is away. She is shown to be intelligent and resourceful, hiding Sarah
              for
              years and protecting her and Kira. Mrs. S used her network to hide Ethan Duncan and find Sarah as a child, claiming to have protected her from Dyad Sarah's whole life. Mrs. S makes a deal with Paul and the military to work with them and
              abduct Helena in exchange for a way to help Sarah and Kira. She eventually is forgiven by both sisters and is stunned as everyone else to learn that the genetic original for both clone lines is her mother Kendall Malone. Biologically
              speaking, Siobhan is Sarah's niece and that would make Kira her cousin. Siobhan later has her mother sent to Iceland, where Cal and Kira are hiding out. After Kendall is murdered by Marty Duko, a vengeful Siobhan eventually kills him.
              In
              the final stages of the clones' war with Neolution, Siobhan persuades Rachel to double-cross her lover Ferdinand, leading to a confrontation in which Siobhan and Ferdinand killed each other.

            <h3 class="heading">Actor Ari Millen as: Mark Rollins, Ira Blair, Rudy, Styles Miller,
              Seth and Parsons</h3>
            <p> Ari Millen as a number of male clones (see here) – the result of a sister project to Project Leda: Project Castor, a top-secret military program. Unlike their Leda counterparts, the Castor clones have always been aware of what they
              are,
              being raised together by the US military; their caretaker was Virginia Coady, who they refer to as Mother. They suffer a mental defect, which basically turns their brains to, quoting Scotty, "Swiss cheese" after set amount of time;
              unfortunately the defect is also an STD, which sterilizes women. Coady studies this, often sending Rudy off on leave to infect new test subjects. The first Castor clone to be introduced to the viewers is Mark Rollins, coming off as a
              homicidal Prolethean, before being exposed as an undercover Castor agent; he marries fellow Prolethean Gracie Johanssen after running away from the Prolethean farm, wanting a normal life with her before his defect kills him. Other major
              Castor clones includes the menacing scarefaced Rudy, the tormented Seth, the crippled Miller and the Neolutionist Ira. All the Castor clones are now deceased, with Mark, the last, executed by Coady. (recurring season 2; regular season
              3–5)
